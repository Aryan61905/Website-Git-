                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <h5>Hi ! My name is Aryan Roy.</h5>
                <p>
                    It can be difficult to express oneself in just words or a Resume,
                    Therefore I created this website where anyone can get to know me better.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At the ripe old age of 22, my firm conviction is that experience builds character. 
                    Growing up, I have been through interesting times, some good and others bad.
                    This, I feel, has made me who I am and what I stand for. I characterize myself as 
                    someone who is hungry to effect change, not just to the world, but in the way people look at the world.
                    My experiences have guided me to the conclusion that my prime interest lies in Computer Science.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the existing experience, a curious mind and the will to learn, I hope to utilize the environment, opportunities,
                    and world class resources provided by the field of Enigneering to Dream, Design, Develop and Deliver innovative
                    products that help in turning creative ideas into a reality.
